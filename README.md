# C-Sharp-and-Unity-Projects<br>
These are C# projects that I have handed into The Tech Academy<br>

# Project 6 Daily Report Submission Assignment<br>
Created a program that was a mock of the Daily report system for the Tech Academy using Visual studio. No exe was created only code was handed in.

# Project 10 Math and Comparison Operators Submission Assignment<br>
Created a program that took in 2 people's wage information, then spits out their annual salary and checks to see who made more.

# Project11 Boolean Logic Submission Assignment<br>
Created a program that assesses whether or not someone is fit for insurance using boolean logic

# Project 16 Branching Submission Assignment<br>
This Program takes in User data regarding a package. Once the Weight, Height, Width, and Length of the package have been gathered it gives a quote based on these factors.

# Project 18 Do While True Loop and Switch<br>
This Program uses both a while true loop and a do-while true loop. First comes the while true loop that cycles through a request for 1 of 3 names. Once that is given, it goes to the do-while true loop and asks you to guess a number between 1-100 with a very good hint.

# Project 21 Arrays Submission Assignment<br>
Practice with Arrays

# Project 23 Six-Part Submission Assignment<br>
A large assignment where I have to use all the tools I've learned up to this point to create the Apps that were requested of me

# Project 25 Exception Assignment<br>
Using a try-catch statement we ask for a number from the user and if they don't produce a whole number we check through several try-catch statements before running the final statement.

# Project 27 Method Assignment<br>
Created four methods in a new class that each takes an integer parameter the user has input and returns an integer. The methods perform addition, division, remainder, and multiplication.

# Project 28 Method Submission<br>
Created 3 methods in a new class with differing math operations but the same name in a different class. I then called each of the methods requiring a string, int, and decimal, and checked to see if they would return an Integer.

# Project 29 Method Submission Assignment<br>
Created a method in a new class that takes 2 user-given integers as parameters, but also checks to see if the 2nd parameter has been put in. A try-catch was used to ensure that when nothing was put into the second input, it would understand to use the default value.

# Project 30 Class Submission Assignment<br>
Created a new class and a void method in that class that takes 2 integers as parameters. The method does a math operation on the first integer and displays the second integer to the screen.

# Project 31 Another Class Submission Assignment<br>
Create a class that has 4 methods in it as requested in this assignment. I had to create an input and output on a Void method, create a method with output parameters, overload the same method, and create a static class.

# Project 32 Methods and Objects Submission Assignment<br>
Created two classes, a Person class, and an Employee class. I populated the Person class with two properties, a Firstname, and Lastname. As well as a method called SayName(). After, In the Employee class, I populated it with a property called ID while having it inherited from the Person class. I then instantiated the Employee Class and called for the Firstname, giving it a string of Sample. Then calling LastName and giving it a string of Student. Lastly calling the superclass method SayName() on the Employee object.

# Project 33 Abstract Class Submission <br>
Created an abstract class called Person that has 2 public string properties and a method called SayName(). Created another class called Employee that inherited from Person and Implements the SayName() method. Then instantiated the Employee class into the Main() program to get firstName and Lastname properties with "sample" "student" and called the SayName method.

# Project 34 Polymorph Assignment <br>
Added an Interface class called IQuittable to the last program and had the Employee Class inherit that interface. Then using polymorph I brought in IQuittable as the Employee class and ran Quit.

# Project 35 Overloading the '==' Operator <br>
Added in an ID property for the Employ Class. Then created an overloading operator that uses the '==' operator which checks 2 employees id's to see if they are the same or not. Then export a message to the console accordingly.

# Project 36 Generic Parameters <br>
Created A class with a generic list perameter, instanciated it into the main progarm then used it to create a string and int.

# Project 37 Enums Project <br>
Created a Enum that holds the days of the week, then ask the user for the current date. Program checks for a number, if true then states to put in a day. If it's not a number then continues to check if the string given is in the Enum Daysoftheweek. If not it sends out a error code to the catch, if so it goes to finaly.

# Project 38 Struct Challenge <br>
Created a Struct that holds a number. Called it in the main program, made a copy of it and had the number Writen to the console.

# Project 40 Lambda Expression Assignment

Created 2 lambda expressions that looped through a list then took the qualifying values and put them into another list. One was based on ID number the other firstName.
